A set of C programs meant to evaluate AFL-CMIN and Stack Hashing as crash unification methods.
Once AFL-CMIN and Stack Hashing have been evaluated against these programs, and some others, we will evaluate a new method, currently being worked on, against this same suite.

INSTALLATION
to download and build these programs run:
- git clone https://github.com/BenjiCooper/Crash_Uniqueness_Evaluation.git
- cd Crash_Uniqueness_Evaluation
- make

NOTE: you may have to modify the CC macro in the Makefile, so it corresponds to your machine's path to afl-gcc
